# Agentic AI Notes

## üß† **Waves of AI Evolution**

*From Rules ‚ûù Learning ‚ûù Creating ‚ûù Acting in the Real World*

---

### **1. Symbolic AI (1950s‚Äì1980s)** ‚Äì üß± *The Rule-Based Thinkers*

This was the **first generation** of AI. It followed **fixed rules** written by humans‚Äîlike ‚Äúif X happens, then do Y.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt learn from experience or data.

> üßæ **Example**: Early chess programs that followed hard-coded rules to make moves.

üìå *Good at solving logic puzzles but failed in real-life messy situations like language or vision.*

---

### **2. Machine Learning (1980s‚Äì2010s)** ‚Äì üìä *The Pattern Learners*

Instead of rules, this AI learns by **looking at data**. It finds patterns using math and statistics. The more data it sees, the smarter it gets.

> üì© **Example**: A spam filter that learns to detect junk emails by analyzing thousands of real messages.

üìå *It learns from data but still struggles with tasks that need deep understanding.*

---

### **3. Deep Learning (2010s‚ÄìPresent)** ‚Äì üß† *The Data Cravers*

A powerful type of Machine Learning that uses **deep (multi-layered) neural networks**. It can understand **images, audio, and text** by training on huge amounts of data.

> üì∑ **Example**: Face recognition on phones, voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.

üìå *Deep Learning made modern AI like computer vision and speech recognition possible.*

---

### **4. Generative AI (2022‚ÄìPresent)** ‚Äì ‚ú® *The Content Creators*

This AI doesn‚Äôt just analyze data‚Äîit **creates new content** like text, code, music, and images based on user prompts. It doesn't think or plan; it just responds creatively.

> ‚úçÔ∏è **Example**: ChatGPT (writes text), DALL¬∑E (makes images), GitHub Copilot (writes code).

üìå *It‚Äôs great at helping with writing, creativity, and idea generation.*

---

### **5. Agentic AI (Emerging)** ‚Äì üéØ *The Goal Achievers*

Agentic AI goes beyond just giving responses. It can **make decisions, plan tasks, use tools**, and even **act independently** to reach a goal without needing constant input.

> üß† **Example**: An AI that can plan a trip‚Äîsearch flights, compare prices, and book tickets on its own.

üìå *This is where AI starts behaving like a real assistant‚Äînot just a chatbot.*

---

### **6. Robotic / Physical AI (Future)** ‚Äì ü§ñ *The Real-World Actors*

This is where **AI meets the physical world**. It combines thinking (Agentic AI) with doing (robots). These AIs can **move, see, pick up objects, and take real-world actions.**

> ü§ñ **Example**: Self-driving cars, warehouse robots, or humanoid robots that assist in hospitals or homes.

üìå *Still developing, but already being tested in cars, drones, and factories.*

## ü§ñ **Types of AI** (ANI, AGI, ASI)

**Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)** is AI that can do one specific task really well, like voice recognition or translating languages.
It‚Äôs smart **only in that one thing**‚Äîcan‚Äôt think or work outside its skill.

> üéØ Example: Siri or Alexa can set reminders, but can‚Äôt write a novel or design a robot.

---

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** is a **theoretical AI** that can think and learn like a human.
It would understand anything, solve many kinds of problems, and even be creative‚Äî**but it doesn‚Äôt exist yet.**

> üß† Example: An AGI could write stories, solve science problems, and hold deep conversations‚Äîall in one system.

---

**Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)** would be **smarter than humans** in every way‚Äîlogic, creativity, emotions, etc.
It‚Äôs a **future idea** and comes with big ethical questions (e.g., how to control it, risks to humans).

> üåç Example: An ASI could cure diseases or design clean energy‚Äîbut also might be hard to manage or stop.

---

> ‚úÖ **Key Add-On**: Right now, we only have **ANI** (narrow AI). AGI and ASI are still in the research/future phase.

---

## üß© **AGI Levels** (From Chatbots to AI Organizations)

**Level 1 ‚Äì Chatbots**
These are basic AI systems that can chat or answer questions, but **can‚Äôt plan or take actions.**
They reply using pre-learned info‚Äîno real "thinking" involved.

> üí¨ Example: A website chatbot that helps with FAQs.

---

**Level 2 ‚Äì Reasoners**
These can **think and solve problems** like puzzles or logical tasks, but still don‚Äôt act on their own.

> üßÆ Example: An AI that solves math problems or creates a step-by-step project plan.

---

**Level 3 ‚Äì Agents**
These are more advanced‚Äîthey **plan, make decisions, and take actions** using tools like APIs or web browsers.

> ‚úàÔ∏è Example: An AI that books a flight on your behalf‚Äîsearches sites, compares prices, and pays.

---

**Level 4 ‚Äì Innovators**
These AIs go beyond tasks. They show **creativity and original thinking**‚Äîthey might invent, design, or discover.

> üí° Example: An AI that creates a new drug formula or writes a unique music style.

---

**Level 5 ‚Äì Organizations**
This is the highest level: **Multiple AIs working together** like a team or company to run big, complex systems.

> üè≠ Example: An AI team that handles everything in a factory‚Äîfrom product design to delivery‚Äîwithout humans.

## What are AI agents? (with example)

**AI agents** are software programs designed to act autonomously on behalf of a user or system. They observe their environment, make decisions, and perform tasks to achieve specific goals. 

* For example, a virtual assistant agent might be instructed to ‚Äúplan a trip‚Äù, then it would autonomously search for flights, book hotels, and schedule reminders without further prompting. In practice, AI agents today often leverage large language models (LLMs) to understand instructions and can call tools or APIs as part of their decision-making process.

## AI Agents vs Agentic AI

An **AI agent** typically refers to a single autonomous program with a task-specific role (like a chatbot or personal assistant). 

In contrast, **Agentic AI** refers to a multi-agent system or framework where many such agents work together on complex, higher-level goals. 

In other words, an AI agent is a building block, whereas agentic AI is the broader system orchestrating many agents. 

* For example, one agent might handle email routing while another handles calendar scheduling, and an agentic AI system would coordinate them to, say, onboard a new employee by delegating sub-tasks to the appropriate agents.

## Generative AI vs Agentic AI

**Generative AI** (e.g. ChatGPT) is designed to generate content‚Äîtext, code, images, etc.‚Äîin response to user prompts. It is reactive, meaning it waits for instructions and then produces outputs. 

**Agentic AI**, on the other hand, is proactive and autonomous: it makes decisions, plans, and takes actions with minimal human guidance. 

In other words, generative AI models create or transform data, while agentic AI systems can execute tasks end-to-end. 

* For example, ChatGPT (a generative model) can write an essay when asked. An agentic AI system could take a high-level goal like ‚Äúincrease customer satisfaction‚Äù and autonomously analyze data, initiate tasks, and coordinate tools to achieve that goal.

## AI Chatbot/Model vs AI Agents  

An **AI chatbot** is typically a conversational interface built on an AI model that follows predefined rules or responds to prompts. It usually answers queries or holds dialogue, but it does not autonomously take actions beyond conversation. 

In contrast, an **AI agent** can plan and execute tasks. Agents can use tools, access external data, and operate continuously until a task is done. 

* For example, a simple chatbot might answer factual questions or schedule a meeting when asked. An AI agent, however, could carry out a complex workflow: it might check your calendar, propose meeting times to attendees, book a conference room, and send confirmation emails automatically. In short, chatbots are conversational responders, whereas agents are action-oriented problem solvers.

## General Agent vs Specialized Agent

A **General or Horizontal Agent** is designed to handle a broad range of tasks across various domains. It is flexible and adaptable, capable of answering diverse questions or performing multiple types of actions without being deeply trained in any one specific field. These agents are useful for day-to-day assistance, research, scheduling, and general productivity support.

In contrast, a **Specialized or vertical Agent** is built or configured for a narrow set of tasks within a specific domain. It has deep expertise or access to domain-specific tools and knowledge, making it more accurate and reliable for specialized use cases.

* For example, a general agent might help plan an entire vacation‚Äîfinding flights, booking hotels, and suggesting activities. A specialized agent, on the other hand, might focus solely on booking flights with advanced options like reward points, fare class, and airline policies. In short, general agents offer wide coverage, while specialized agents offer depth and precision in a focused area.


## Future of Agentic AI

Agentic AI is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. Industry experts predict 2025 as a pivotal year for agents ‚Äì for instance, one survey found 99% of developers exploring or building AI agents, suggesting 2025 will be the ‚Äúyear of the agent‚Äù. 

Enterprises anticipate that agentic AI will automate routine workflows (like employee onboarding or IT provisioning) and greatly boost productivity. In a few years we may see domain-specific agent teams: e.g., one agent that manages cloud resources working seamlessly with another that handles service requests, proactively collaborating on tasks. Early uses include offloading repetitive work to agents so human workers can focus on creative problems.

## What are Anthropic

**Anthropic** is an AI research company founded by former OpenAI researchers, known for creating the Claude language models. It focuses on building safe, interpretable, and human-aligned AI systems.

## Agents vs Workflows?

The Anthropic Agents vs Workflows concept shows how to build smart AI systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) like those from Anthropic. An "agent" is a system that works on its own, while a "workflow" follows a set plan. Anthropic calls both part of "agentic systems" but notes a key difference: workflows use fixed steps, and agents make their own choices.

## Key Concepts

### What Are Agents?

**Definition:** Agents can be independent systems that work alone for a long time with tools, or systems that follow specific plans. Anthropic groups all these as agentic systems.  
**Key Trait:** Agents decide how to use tools and complete tasks on their own, making them unpredictable and able to repeat steps (recursive).

### What Are Workflows?

**Definition:** Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools follow pre-set code paths, like a fixed recipe.  
**Key Trait:** They are predictable, don‚Äôt repeat steps (no recursion), and use planned actions.

### When to Use Agents or Workflows

- **Start Simple:** Begin with the easiest solution, like a single LLM call with examples, if it works.  
- **Workflows:** Best for tasks needing consistency and clear steps.  
- **Agents:** Ideal when flexibility and the LLM‚Äôs own decisions are needed for big tasks.  
- **Trade-Off:** Agentic systems may be slower and cost more but perform better on complex jobs.


By leveraging the OpenAI Agents SDK, developers can effectively implement these design patterns, as outlined by Anthropic, to build robust and efficient AI agent systems.

### Example of Agents vs Workflows

- **Workflow Example:** For writing a report, a workflow follows steps like ‚Äúoutline, write, check‚Äù in order for a steady result.  
- **Agent Example:** For planning a trip, an agent might check flights, hotels, and weather on its own, adjusting as needed.

 ### Anthropic‚Äôs Five Agentic Workflow Design Patterns
OpenAI's Agents SDK is a versatile framework designed to facilitate the development and orchestration of AI agents, enabling them to perform complex tasks efficiently. This SDK aligns closely with several design patterns proposed by Anthropic for building effective agents, allowing developers to implement these patterns seamlessly.

1. ### Prompt Chaining (Chain Workflow):

This pattern involves breaking down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler, manageable steps, where each step builds upon the previous one. The Agents SDK supports this by allowing developers to define agents that execute specific functions in a predetermined order, ensuring a structured approach to task completion.

2. ### Routing:

Routing entails directing tasks to the most appropriate agent based on the task's nature. The Agents SDK facilitates this through its handoff mechanism, enabling agents to transfer control to other agents better suited to handle specific subtasks, thereby optimizing task management.

3. ### Parallelization:

This pattern focuses on executing multiple subtasks concurrently to enhance efficiency. With the Agents SDK, developers can design agents that operate in parallel, leveraging the SDK's orchestration capabilities to manage simultaneous processes effectively.

4. ### Orchestrator-Workers:

In this design, an orchestrator agent decomposes a complex task into smaller subtasks and assigns them to worker agents. The Agents SDK's architecture supports this by allowing an orchestrator agent to oversee the workflow and delegate tasks to specialized worker agents, ensuring coordinated task execution.

5. ### Evaluator-Optimizer:

This pattern involves iterative improvement through feedback loops, where an evaluator agent assesses the performance of other agents and suggests optimizations. The Agents SDK's guardrails feature enables the implementation of such evaluative mechanisms, allowing for continuous performance enhancement and adherence to desired behaviors.


## Quick Takeaways

- Agents are self-managing systems for flexible, complex tasks.  
- Workflows follow set steps for predictable, routine jobs.  
- Start with simple LLM calls, then use workflows for clarity or agents for adaptability.  
- Anthropic‚Äôs patterns (Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Orchestrator-Workers, Evaluator-Optimizer) provide tailored ways to build these systems.  
- Choose based on your task: fixed steps or dynamic decisions.
